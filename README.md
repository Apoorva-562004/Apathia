# Real-Time Smart Traffic Management System

This project is an Intelligent Traffic Optimization System built using React for the frontend, AWS for deployment, Mapbox for mapping, and MongoDB for data storage.

## Overview

The Real-Time Smart Traffic Management System is designed to optimize traffic flow in urban areas by leveraging IoT sensors and real-time data analytics. The system aims to reduce congestion and improve overall traffic efficiency.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: The system uses IoT sensors to monitor traffic conditions in real-time.
- **Traffic Optimization**: Through real-time data analytics, the system identifies congestion points and suggests optimal routes to reduce congestion.
- **Data Storage and Analysis**: Data collected from IoT sensors is stored in MongoDB and analyzed to identify trends and patterns in traffic flow.


## Usage

- **Traffic Monitoring**: View real-time traffic conditions on the map.
- **Route Optimization**: Get suggested optimal routes to avoid congestion.
- **Data Analysis**: Access historical traffic data and analytics.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability. To deploy the application on AWS, follow these steps:

1. Set up an AWS account and create an EC2 instance.
2. Install Node.js and MongoDB on the EC2 instance.
3. Clone the repository to the EC2 instance.
4. Install dependencies and start the application.
